# flutter_mvc_mvvm_mvi
Project to show practical example of mvc, mvvm and mvi architectures.

MVC is still widely used for its simplicity and because it is easy to implement, but it can become problematic in larger applications due to coupling between layers.

MVVM solves many of the limitations of MVC, better separating responsibilities and facilitating testing and code reuse, especially in projects that make extensive use of reactive bindings.

MVI, in turn, is ideal for modern applications where predictability and unidirectional data control are essential, offering a more declarative approach to managing complex states.
